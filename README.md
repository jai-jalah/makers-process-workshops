# Process Workshops #

## What are they? ##
A coach will facilitate a session where you and up to 15 others from any cohort will pair up and get close feedback on your approach to programming.

## What will happen? #
You’ll pair up and spend 30 mins observing your partner record their screen and TDD an exercise, while you use a rubric to note down what and how they do in order to give them useful feedback.

And then you switch - you’ll record your screen and TDD an exercise for 30 mins while your partner observes to give feedback

## Exercises ##
Here are the possible programs to build. Complete them in the following order:

Leap Years
Middle letter
Ten minute walk
Scrabble solver
Checkout
Change Converter
Echo
Bank

## Who should do this? ##
Anyone at any stage of their learning here at Makers. You could do it during week 1 or week 7 or week 15 or any week you are here.

The objective is simply to practice and get feedback to improve your approach to programming.

## Why should I do this? ##
For a number of reasons.

Practicing writing code while under observation helps show you how good your current process is - where do you get stuck, how are you debugging, how's your approach to TDD - and therefore an accelerated way to improve.

Usefully you'll get feedback from your pair, and a recording to re-watch yourself write code.

It's great feedback and confidence-boosting to show yourself you're getting better at programming.
